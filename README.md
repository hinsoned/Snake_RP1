 Coding with a tutorial for practice with Pygame and GitHub

Changes I made to the original:
- The colors in the original were terrible so I picked a more muted background.
- The speed of the snake on my computer was different than that in the tutorial video so I had to adjust. I do not understand why but I got the snake up to a reasonable speed.
- Added a sound effect for when the snake ate the food.
- Added one of my own songs as a music loop for the background
- The snake speeds up with each food eaten.

Changes I would like to make:
