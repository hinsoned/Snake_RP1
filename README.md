# Snake_RP1
 Coding with a tutorial for practice with Pygame and GitHub

 The link to the first video in the series:

Changes I made to the original:
- The colors in the original were terrible so I picked a more muted background.
- The speed of the snake on my computer was different than that in the tutorial video so I had to adjust. I do not understand why but I got the snake up to a reasonable speed.


Changes I would like to make:
- I would like the snake to move faster with each piece of food it eats. This should be easy.
- I want to add sound effects for when the snake eats the food.
- I would like to add a loop of music in the background of the game. I may use some old demo of mine for that purpose.
